# InstagramBot
This is a simple implementation of oAuth for Instagram.

The script contains only two files index.php and Insta.php. To use this script login to your instagram account and create sample application then use the credentials generated by instagram in Insta.php like CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI.

Note: Script will work only if APP URL and REDIRECT_URI are same because everything is implemented in a single file index.php.
